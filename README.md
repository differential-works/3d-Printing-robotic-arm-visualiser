# Robotic 3D printing - Slicer and visualiser template

![image](https://github.com/differential-works/3d-Printing-robotic-arm-visualiser/blob/main/GitHub%20Ani.gif?raw=true) 

This repository contains a general-purpose Grasshopper definition designed for simulating, visualizing, and animating the tool path movement of robotic arms for 3D printing applications.

## Plugins Required

To utilize this Grasshopper definition, ensure you have the following plugins/libraries installed:

- [ROBOTS](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/robots) (by Visose)
- [HUMAN](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/human) (by Andrew Heumann)

## Usage

Detailed steps and descriptions are provided within the *.gh file, guiding you through the process of setting up and utilizing the robotic arm visualizer.

## Summary
The setup can be intimidating for those who are new to this space. We hope this script lowers the barrier and serves as an educational tool / quick start guide for those looking to experiment digitally and generate visuals for their projects.
